<h3>Feminism is the equality between gender both male and female. They were created because people disliked bias in gender, giving advantage and disadvantage for some.</h3>

<h3/>People looked down on women as many histories came down to express women as a weak creature. 
Before 1970, women didn't have credit card, weren’t able to vote , could get fired for being pregnant, can't be astronauts, etc.<h3>

<h3>Then people spoke up  and built up feminism for the weaker ones who couldn’t stand up for themself. One important feminism was Elizabeth Cady Stanton. She is a famously known woman to gain women's rights in 20th-century. <h3>
